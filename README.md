# Web Page from Design

## 📘 Introduction

This project involves building a complete web page based on a provided design. The design comes in the form of two images: one showing the full layout and another outlining the fonts and color choices.

The goal is to recreate the layout as closely as possible using semantic HTML and CSS. Pixel-perfect precision is not required — the focus is on replicating the structure, layout, and visual feel of the design.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS styling including Flexbox layout
- Working with fonts, colors, and spacing
- Basic web design interpretation from a mockup
- Version control using Git
- Publishing a project with GitHub Pages

## 📝 Notes

- Images used in this project are either free-to-use or properly credited (see below).
- You are encouraged to replace placeholder text and images with your own content.
- Mobile responsiveness is not required for this project — that will come in a future lesson.
